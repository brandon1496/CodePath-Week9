# CodePath-Week9
Time Spent: 3 hours 
# Objective
Create a basic honeypot and demonstrate its effectiveness at detecting and/or collecting data about an attack
# Overview
I created 2 VMs, one called mhn-admin another called mhn-honeypot-1. I followed CodePath instructions on how to create them. I attacked the honeypot and the results was shown on the admin page. Also the admin page shows whos attacking the honeypot and from where.

- Heres a Gif link to see the admin page with the attack results : https://imgur.com/a/d2htF
- Included a file called sessions.json that has the data collected from my honeypot(mhn-honeypot-1).
